# Advanced techniques for estimating degrees of freedom in a non central chi distribution

This section is mostly personal recommendations based on some literature, stuff I have played with
and stuff I have seen in MR physics classes. It is probably not exhaustive nor perfectly accurate,
but should give the interested reader a feeling of what is happening and why.

### The problem

Noise estimation in MR highly depends on
the reconstruction algorithm implemented by your vendor (*Dietrich et al.*). Unfortunately,
due to interference between adjacent receiver coils as used in modern parallel imaging
(i.e. pretty much always unless you are doing fancy specialized acquisitions),
the real noise distribution is slightly different than a pure Rician or
Noncentral chi distribution (*Aja-Fernandez et al., Constantinides et al.*).

It is still possible to estimate the distribution,
but the values of the 'standard deviation' and degrees of freedom of that distribution
depends on the parameters of the acquisition (i.e. SENSE maps, GRAPPA weights),
which are probably hard to acquire if you do not have a friendly MR physicist at hand
(they are always nice guys anyway, so don't be afraid to ask for help).
The authors of (*Aja-Fernandez et al.*) still offer a way to do a blind estimation of these values for
those interested to dig a bit more.

### Why it is hard to find a surefire correction method

Also based on my MR physics class understanding, due to the way the (closed source)
algorithm in each vendor's scanner software work, they are likely to discard
the signal coming from far away receiver elements from the imaged body region.
As an example, near the top of the head, the coil elements placed near the neck are very likely to measure
little relevant signal and mostly contribute noise.

This means that during the k-space reconstruction, the signal
contribution from these coils will get thrown away, and thus the number of effectively used coils will vary per region and will be lower than the number of coils on you receiver array. Add noise correlation into that
due to electrical interference and proximity of your receiver elements, and you are looking at some (hard to figure out) distribution which is different from what you expect according to the theory.

### What other people suggest

The authors of (*Veraart et al.*) also provided another way to estimate those
relevant parameters based on constructing synthetic noise maps for those
interested in trying another method.

As a final tl;dr advice, some other studies have found that for GRAPPA reconstruction,
with a 12 channels head coils N=4 (*Brion et al.*) \(that's what we use in Sherbrooke also
for the 1.5T Siemens scanner with a 12 channels head coil\)
works well and for a 32 channels head coils (*Varadarajan et al.*), a value around N=9 seems to work
(remember that N varies spatially, but it seems to be fairly homogeneous/vary slowly).

The authors of (*Becker et al.*) also indicates that in
the worst case, using N=1 for Rician noise is better than doing nothing.

Same observation from (*Sakaie et al.*) in real data; they fitted the background distribution and found out that for a sum of square (SoS) reconstruction with 12 coils, N = 3.76 ± 0.07 in 5 subjects (well, it should be an integer since it represents the number of degrees of freedom, so let's say N=4). As expected, it is much lower than 12 because of the correlation in each adjacent coils and produces DTI metrics (FA, MD, RD, AD) with a stronger bias than an adaptive combine (N = 1.03 ± 0.01) reconstruction.

### Take home message

In all cases, the take home message would be that estimating the real value for N
is still challenging, but it will most likely be lower than the number of coils present on
your receiver coil due to the way MRI scanners reconstruct and combine images.

My new personal recommendation would now be to use the default option, that is to estimate both parameters of the distribution at once from the background noise.
While this will underestimate most of the time the correct noise standard deviation, it seems more stable than guessworking or assuming N=1 in general, all the while providing a good ballpark estimate for the denoising process, see *St-Jean et al.* for more details.

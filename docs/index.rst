Welcome to NLSAM's documentation!
=================================

This is the documentation detailing the internal of the non local spatial and angular matching (NLSAM) denoising algorithm for diffusion MRI, which is available at https://github.com/samuelstjean/nlsam.

You can find the original paper and full details of the algorithm as presented in
::
    St-Jean, S., Coupé, P., & Descoteaux, M. (2016)
    "Non Local Spatial and Angular Matching :
    Enabling higher spatial resolution diffusion MRI datasets through adaptive denoising."
    Medical Image Analysis, 32(2016), 115–130.

Which you can grab a copy from the publisher website_ or from arxiv_.

You can find below the documentation for each modules and a few instructions on topics such as noise estimation and detailed installation instructions.
